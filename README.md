# JSONToForm

Hi, so the code will be held in the client folder. There you will have the front-end and back-end. To place a specific JSON inside the system look for the "public" folder in the "api" folder. There will then be a JSONObjects folder and that's where you'll find the path.

If you want to see more of the development and how to declare validation or entry types see the folder called SubmissionFiles. In there you'll find a Blog Post and How to Guide. Those will hold index.html files, which talks about the syntax and my experience.
