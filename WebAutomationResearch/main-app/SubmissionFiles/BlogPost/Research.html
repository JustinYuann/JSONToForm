										<h1>Project's Purpose</h1>
									</header>
									<p>The project’s purpose is to create a web interface to interact with a database. The goal is to use a specification to define a CRUD application and then automatically use this specification to produce all of the extra, html, config and other files needed to create a web application with popular web frameworks, like React or Vue. Overall, the purpose is to define a minimal set of information that can create the majority of a common CRUD web app project. </p>
									<br>
									<p>In this Blog Post, I will be going through what the project should do and what steps to get there, so that if you wanted to continue, you have my knowledge and resources.</p>

										<h1>Project Features</h1>
									</header>
									<ul>
										<li>Ability to create instances of a user-defined JSON Object using a form</li>
										<li>Ability to view, update or delete created objects</li>
										<li>Ability to set tasks to other objects from other objects. For example, Manager object would task an Employee Object</li>
										<li>Ability to have different views and permission, e.g., system administrators</li>
										<li>Have a login system and logging system to keep track of stats that could be used to improve management</li>

										<h1>What is MVC & CRUD</h1>
									</header>
									<p>MVC stands for Model-View-Controller and it's a software design pattern. It's commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three connected parts. </p>
									<br>
									<p>Model is known as the central component. It’s the application dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application. For this project, the model is seen as the database, MongoDB is the one that is in the project.</p>
									<br>
									<p>View is known as any representation of information from the model, that could be charts, diagrams or tables. You can have multiple views integrate the same information based on the entity’s permissions. For example, a bar chart for management but a tabular view for accountants. For the project, the view is seen as the front-end framework, React is the one that is in the project. </p>
									<br>
									<p>Controller is known as the middleman between the View and Model. It handles the inputs and outputs from the View and gets the necessary data from the Model. For example, requesting specific information in the View and receiving from the Model then displaying it on the View. In this project, the Controller is seen as the back-end framework, Node.js is the one that is in the project. </p>
									<br>
									<p>CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete and it’s the four basic functions that models should be able to do. So, in our case, each entity in the system like an employee should have one or more of those functions. For example, a manager maybe able to delete while an employee may only be able to do read.</p>
									<br>
									<p>In conclusion, the project should be implementing all the above to create a typical management system. </p>
