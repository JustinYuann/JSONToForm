										<h1>My Approach</h1>
									</header>
									<h1>Setting my Mindset</h1>
									<p>My first step was to declare what was my mindset for this project. As my lecturer said, “it’s marathon not a sprint”. I suggest you take this mentality especially with learning something new, like a new framework because you don’t want to tire yourself and become fed up with coding. Set a small number of hours each day to purely concentrate on coding. </p>
									<p>Take small steps and build a solid foundation for each of your frameworks. Also, when going through a set of tutorials don’t mindlessly copy the code; pause the video, take comments and experiemnt with it. That’s how you really learn in my opinion. </p>
									<p>Finally, make sure you truly understand what you’re making, I didn’t expect to know fully how I'll automate the process but I knew the stages to get up to that point, for me it was how to learn to create a fullstack application. </p>
									<h1>Setting up my Tools</h1>
									<p>By tools I mean what technologies and programs I’ll be using. At the start I was switching through a lot of IDEs like IntelliJ and PyCharm. But I decided on VSCode this was due to the tutorials’ recommendation buts also the plugins that I’ve been told that I could install to aid my development. I decided to use Node.js instead of Flask because I didn’t want to switch between Python and Javascript. Therefore, I used React and Javascript. Finally, my database was purely chosen from the tutorials I would be following which all adapted MERN. So, in conclusion, it’s best to follow the tutorial’s recommendations and languages as best as you can!  </p>
									<h1>What Tutorials Did I Follow</h1>
									<p>I followed many tutorials and saw many that were paid for. But I decided to use a free trial on SkillShare. It had many tutorials that specifically developed in MERN. I started on the most recent uploaded one with the highest number of students, this was to ensure it was good quality but also that the frameworks were up to date! This is the tutorial I'm currently following. <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Learn-React-MongoDB-Nodejs-and-Express-by-coding-a-charts-generator/655300638?via=search-layout-grid">Tutorial .</a></p>
