										<h1>My Errors and Bugs</h1>
									</header>
									<p>When coding, you'll encounuter errors, typos and compatibility issues; it's a given. In this section, I'll be talking about the errors and mistakes I've made so far. </p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/ReactError.webp" alt="" /></span>
									<h1>React | Class Components vs Functional Components</h1>
									<p>I ran into the problem when, more recent tutorials would follow React's new Functional Component syntax while older ones would follow the old Class Componentsyntax. They weren't big changes but it's pretty hard when learning to translate an older tutorial to work with new syntax. But it wasn't all that bad, this tested my knowledge of React and how and why components are declared that way. Class and Functional Components do the same jobs but are declared differently. </p>
									<p><em>The bottom is a Functional Component and the top is a Class Component</em></p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/FunctionalComponent.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h1>React | Captilization Matters</h1>
									<p>I ran into a problem I couldn't fixed, I followed the tutorial in the best way possible while trying to convert all Class Components to Functional Components. Unlike other languages, the error message didn't help me solve the problem, I tried everything and watched the tutorial many times. I was tempeted to just switch it back to a Class Component but I decided to post it on the React discord and instantly was told that I spelt "Form.Group" without a capital "G"</p>
									<p>What I'm trying to say is that, don't give up and just ask for help. Even though I didn't solve it myself, it felt pretty good solving my first problem in a brand new langauge.</p>
									<p><em>Code on the Left, Errors on the Right</em></p>

									<h1>Avoid Old Tutorials</h1>
									<p>Like the heading said, avoid using Old Tutorials! They can cause a lot of compatibility issues with Node modules, installers and for me I always was scared of when following a old tutorial incase of these problems have arised. When following tutorials you want to ensure nothing can go wrong especially if you're learning something completely new.</p>
									<p>Here's a list of tutorials that I recommend you follow</p>
									<ul>
										<li><a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Learn-React-MongoDB-Nodejs-and-Express-by-coding-a-charts-generator/655300638?via=search-layout-grid">Tutorial 1</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes/The-Complete-React-Bootcamp-2020-w-React-Hooks-Firebase/895676015?via=search-layout-grid">Tutorial 2</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb1vy1HpVwk&ab_channel=THESHOW">Tutorial 3</a></li>
									</ul>
									<h1>Small Steps</h1>
									<p>This is a human bug I'd say. I was so focused on trying to figure out how would I automate such a complicated process that it held me back from just coding and just learning how to make a fullstack in the first place. The way the I fixed this bug was just taking small steps everytime I coded. I set achievable goals and didn't tire myself out. Rome wasn't build in a day they say. Just focus on the basics of each framework, connect them and get some CRUD going!</p>
